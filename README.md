This Open Source game employs multiple accessibility options to control a real robotic arm: voice input, 
face detection and mind control. The Claw was built by Mark Chen, Michael Wang, Stacie Hibino, Jun Chen, 
Powen Ko, and Shawn Jackson completely during iOSDevCamp 2013 using vitapolyâ€˜s Objective C / Unity framework.
